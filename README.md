# README.md

## Getting Started

To set up and use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/pijuspet/motion-vector-extractors
```
2. **Install the required Python packages**
```bash
make install
```

3. Setup ffmpeg project:
```
make setup_ffmpeg
```

5. Setup vtune:
```
./intel-vtune-2025.5.0.40.sh
```

## Running the Benchmark

To run the full benchmark run:
```
make run_benchmark
```

- Replace video with your input video file from the videos in `videos/`.

During execution, you’ll be presented with options. If you select **option `0`**, the script will:
- Run all benchmarks.
- Generate charts.
- Create a PowerPoint presentation (PPT).

> **Note:** Selecting option 0 will take longer because it performs both the benchmarks and the full reporting.

## Generate motion vector video
```
make generate_video
```

videos are saved in `/results/[date]` folder (requires `method0_output_0.csv` and `method4_output_0.csv` files, run `make benchmark` with flag 0 beforehand).

## Results Output

After the benchmarks are complete:
- All plot images (`.png`) and the PowerPoint presentation (`.ppt`), including the results, will be available in the `plot` folder.
- Motion vectors, vtune results are saved in `/results/[date]/` folder.

## Current Results 

> **Note:** The 3 with FFMPEG Patched use the Naive return version of FFMPEG, and the one called "Same" - is a copy of the code that performs best on the patched running not  on the Patched
